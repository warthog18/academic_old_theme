In questa sezione ho raccolto alcune poesie, scritte in particolari momenti della mia vita.

La scelta di pubblicarle su questo sito è stata dura, perché sono delle poesie abbastanza personali,
ma che potrebbero servire ad altre persone che hanno provato le mie stesse sensazioni.
Inoltre è sempre utile ricevere un giudizio del lettore.

Queste poesie sono state un aiuto in alcuni momenti difficili ed è un esercizio
molto valido per affinare di più la mia conoscenza della lingua inglese.
Infatti credo che non sia così semplice scrivere in una lingua che non è la propria, e le rime complicano seriamente le cose.

Purtroppo non riesco a risalire alle date esatte in cui sono state scritte, ma posso dire che risalgono al periodo che inizia dall'estate del 2004.

Buona lettura!

<br/><br/>
**Loneliness - Summer 2004**

Loneliness, you don't realize of her<br>
and she's already there<br>
She has long arms to surrond you<br>
in a dull embrace<br>
turing a clear path into a foggy trace<>br

She can sweep away<br>
all my happy thoughts<br>
about friends, love, the wolrd iself is now<br>
grey<br>

It's like living in a closed, locked case<br>
alone without any grace<br>
I loose my hold on reality<br>
I have to strain to fight<br>
against her brutality<br>
But my hands are bare<br>
and my force is no more<br>

Wait, I'm not alone<br>
there's the loneliness over me,<br>
we talk to each other<br>
She's sitting on her throne<br>
She is my beloved, my princess<br>
I live with the loneliness<br>

<br/><br/>
**Loneliness, sweet fantasy - Autumn 2004**

I could live happy moments with her<br>
Not much is required,<br>
loneliness, torpor, darkness<br>
I can imagine thousands of stories<br>
Oh, so sweet fantasy,<br>
spare me some company<br>
'Cos only when you are<br>
I'm happy<br>
Alone no more<br>

She's so beautiful,<br>
we're talking to each other,<br>
smiling and leading us,<br>
hand in hand into foreseen matters<br>
I'm fine with her<br>
but she isn't real<br>
I woke up in my bed<br>
'cos she was without the head<br>

<br/><br/>
**Breaking in - Spring 2005**

Like lighting in a cloudless sky<br>
Like a laugh after a sorrow cry<br>
I've heard you breaking in<br>

'Twas a fast moment, not long, not planned<br>
A sweet touch and voice and my heart,<br>
Clamped<br>
You were ruling the game<br>
with the impetuousness of impatient child,<br>
cheeky as if you knew me for years<br>

Like a sudden flash after ages of darkness<br>
Like a thread of hope after despair knitting<br>
I've felt you breaking in<br>

I fell,<br>
not because of weakness<br>
not because of your shamelessness<br>
I fell because of the whole you<br>

Time will pass,<br>
like the light through a glass,<br>
future unclear,<br>
like a fabric not stoo sheer<br>
A single thing I surely know<br>
I was living my life and suddenly<br>
without warning<br>
I've heard you breaking in<br>

**A piece that doesn't fit - July 2005**

Three weeks ago I begun a puzzle<br>
That puzzle was your face<br>
I saw it growing every day<br>
Your smile coming up pace by pace<br>

And day by day, a simple carton shape<br>
a piece from the lot I placed<br>
How to figure out where it mate?<br>
Then the original hidden fear<br>
slowly came up, thin as a spear.<br>

A single hole in the puzzle remained<br>
A small piece in the bunch, explained:<br>
I realize the uselessness of the game<br>
as my hand was holding that small coloured strain<br>

After all, there was no point in trying to fit<br>
that strange piece,<br>
the last of the heap.<br>

<br/><br/>
**The Art of Waiting - February 2006**

I could feel you like my shadow,<br>
You were following my steps,<br>
Behind me, hiding like a shy child<br>

Explicit invitation can bring emotions,<br>
but for how long?<br>
Carrying on values can bring strenght,<br>
but for how long?<br>

Sufferings between us,<br>
two untidy lifes fighting for matching<br>

You demanded something I was not to give,<br>
You demanded something I was not to perceive.<br>
I will give my prudence to the hurried,<br>
My patience to the impulsive,<br>
My spirit to the sensual<br>

Ask for discernment,<br>
Ask for true Love,<br>
Ask for the Art of Waiting.<br>
